Question 16. How To Made Mirror Server For Live Data Sync ?

Answer :

Exactly the same version of Zimbra must be installed on both the live and mirror server. 
To start with we work on the live server. There is no need to stop Zimbra for most of the install.
 Only a short amount of down-time will need to be scheduled later to perform a final rsync operation between the two servers.

Go As user root....

# apt-get install inotify-tools on both server Main and Mirror server.

service zimbra stop on Mirror server.

# rsync -aHz --force --delete live_server:/opt/zimbra/ /opt/zimbra/

# service zimbra start

service zimbra start

service zimbra status
