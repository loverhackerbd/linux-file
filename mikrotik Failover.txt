We use 2 ISPs for later load balancing,


/ ip address
add address = 192.168.0.1 / 24 disabled = no interface = WAN1 network = 192.168.0.0
add address = 192.168.1.2 / 24 disabled = no interface = WAN2 network = 192.168.1.0
add address = 192.168.2.2 / 24 disabled = no interface = LAN network = 192.168.2.0

First, we make marking for load balancer.


/ ip firewall mangle
add action = mark-connection chain = input disabled = no in-interface = WAN1 new-connection-mark = WAN1_connmark passthrough = yes
add action = mark-connection chain = input disabled = no in-interface = WAN2 new-connection-mark = WAN2_connmark passthrough = yes
add action = mark-routing chain = output connection-mark = WAN1_connmark disabled = no new-routing-mark = ke_ISP1 passthrough = yes
add action = mark-routing chain = output connection-mark = WAN2_connmark disabled = no new-routing-mark = ke_ISP2 passthrough = yes
add action = mark-connection chain = prerouting disabled = no dst-address-type =! LAN in-interface = LAN new-connection-mark = WAN1_connmark passthrough = yes per-connection-classifier = both-addresses-and-ports: 2 / 0
add action = mark-connection chain = prerouting disabled = no dst-address-type =! LAN in-interface = LAN new-connection-mark = WAN2_connmark passthrough = yes per-connection-classifier = both-addresses-and-ports: 2 / 1
add action = mark-routing chain = prerouting connection-mark = WAN1_connmark disabled = no in-interface = LAN new-routing-mark = ke_ISP1 passthrough = yes
add action = mark-routing chain = prerouting connection-mark = WAN2_connmark disabled = no in-interface = LAN new-routing-mark = ke_ISP2 passthrough = yes

Setting masquerade for both ISP links

/ ip firewall nat
add action = masquerade chain = srcnat disabled = no out-interface = WAN1
add action = masquerade chain = srcnat disabled = no out-interface = WAN2


Setting Route to implement FailOver 2 ISP Load Balancing PCC Without Netwatch.

His weapon in this session. 

## Setting static routes of each host to each of your ISP gateways:

/ ip route
add dst-address = 8.8.8.8 gateway = 192.168.0.1 scope = 10
add dst-address = 8.8.4.4 gateway = 192.168.1.1 scope = 10

## Setting static routes to each host from your load balancing mikrotik routing mark:


/ ip route
add distance = 1 gateway = 8.8.8.8 routing-mark = ke_ISP1 check-gateway = ping
add distance = 2 gateway = 8.8.4.4 routing-mark = ke_ISP2 check-gateway = ping

## Setting IP hop "virtual / boong2an" which we will use for the next routing setting:

/ ip route
add dst-address = 10.20.30.1 gateway = 8.8.8.8 scope = 10 target-scope = 10 check-gateway = ping
add dst-address = 10.20.30.2 gateway = 8.8.4.4 scope = 10 target-scope = 10 check-gateway = ping

## Add a default route for both your ISPs that are already marked in mangle:


/ ip route
add distance = 1 gateway = 10.20.30.1 routing-mark = ke_ISP1
add distance = 2 gateway = 10.20.30.2 routing-mark = ke_ISP2

## Add the default route for your mikrotik:

/ ip route
add distance = 1 gateway = 10.20.30.1
add distance = 2 gateway = 10.20.30.2
